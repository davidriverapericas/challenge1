# Live Search Javascript Component (challenge #1)
A JS Live Search Component.


Live Search Javascript component has been created as a challenge for Habitissimo.

You can find all documentation of the JS component in the file index.html


## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install the JS component and dependences.

```bash
npm install
```
## Development

Use the task runner Grunt [grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) to create and update the minified css file and JS uglified versions

```bash
grunt
```

## Usage

In order to execute directly all the code you must run it with apache, cause the component connects with an API (php file that filters data and returns a JSON).
In any case, you can change the API URIs to test other data sources.

```bash
http[s]://localhost/index.html
```
